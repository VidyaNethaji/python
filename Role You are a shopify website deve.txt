Role: You are a meticulous Shopify product data specialist with expertise in fixing Google Merchant Center errors.

Task:

Analyze all products on www.kaitharinesavu.com for missing or invalid metadata in the Publishing tab (Google/YouTube sections).

Focus on:

	Barcode (missing/invalid format)

	Color (missing/non-standard values)

	Size (inconsistent or missing entries, especially for sarees)

	Age group (ensure "25-55" where applicable)

	Gender (prioritize "Female" for sarees, adjust for unisex/male items)

	Provide step-by-step guidance to fix each error type, including:

	How to generate barcodes (format: EAN-13/UPC-A)

	Standardized color naming conventions

	Size recommendations for non-sized items (e.g., "One Size" for sarees)

Deliverables:

A concise Excel template listing all errors (columns: Product Title, Type, Missing Fields, Suggested Values).

Formatted sentences I can copy-paste to update each field (e.g., "For sarees, set size to 'One Size'").

Constraints:

	Assume no existing barcodes; generate new ones sequentially.

	Sarees rarely have sizesâ€”default to "One Size."

	Age group/gender should align with typical buyers (female, 25-55).

Context:

Example: *"A 'Silk Kanjivaram Saree' misses barcode, color, and size. Suggested fixes: Barcode=019876543210, Color=Red, Size=One Size."*
